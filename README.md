Teammates contributions-

Jihao Zhang:

    - implemented sciArithmetic
    - implemented the model of arithmetic
    - implemented the memory buttons disabled effect
    - implemented the MS button logic in memoryFunction.js
    - Binded the scientific calculator to controller(including clear buttons, digit buttons, unary&binary operator buttons and "(" / ")" buttons)
    - helped designing the test plan for scientific Calculator

Max Zahner:

    - Model for equations in regular (non-scientific calculator)
    - Current Expression construction
    - Handled imaginary number errors
    - Imported and refactored logic to math.js
    - Handled single operation operands
    - Modified DEL to work on operation and prevOperand
    - Modified addOperation to fit with single operand operations
    - Logic for equal (if no operation and current operand is specified, the previous operation and operand are applied to the leading operand)
    - Updated memory functions to math.js instead of ordinary js math

Yiming Liu:

    - CSS for the calculator and scientific mode toggle function
    - Model the structure of controller, memory functions and the calculator in standard mode
    - Created constructor of the Calculator and the functions of appendNumber, addOperations, and getCurrNum
    - Created scientific mode button listener

Yinchu Sun:

    - Created all clear structures in clear.js
    - Implemented the "C" button (clear all function) in clear.js
    - Implemented the "+/-" button (negate) listener in clear.js
    - Implemented the original negate function.
    - Created ifValid function in controller.js

    - Implemented the memoryRecall function in memoryFunction.js

Jeremy Mach:

    - Moved functions to controller.js, clear.js
    - memoryStore in memoryFunction.js
    - memoryAdd in memoryFunctions.js
    - Implemented the initial memory listeners, got changed later
    - Implemented memory in HTML and CSS
    - Added various calculations in arithmetic.js
    - Wrote test cases for memoryStore, memoryClear, CE, C, DEL
